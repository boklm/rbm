rbm_cli(7)
==========

NAME
----
rbm_cli - The rbm command line interface

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'rbm' <action> <project> [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The rbm commands usually take as first argument an action, then a
project's name and some options.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

Many of the configuration options that can be set in the main configuration
file and projects configuration files can also be overriden with command
line options. The name of the command line option is the same as the
configuration file option, prepended with '--', and with '_' replaced
by '-'. For instance "output_dir: out" in the configuration file can be
replaced by "--output-dir=out".

The following options can be set on the command line :

 --sysconf-file=<file>::
     Set the optional system configuration file path

 --target=<target>::
     Set the target. This option can be used multiple times to use more
     than one target. See link:rbm_targets.html[rbm_targets(7)] for
     details.

 --output-dir=<directory>::
     Set the output directory

 --version=<version>::
     Set the package version

 --pkg-rel=<rel>::
     Set package release number

 --distribution=<distribution>::
     The name of the linux distribution to build package for. See
     link:rbm_distributions.html[rbm_distributions(7)] for details.

 --fetch::
 --no-fetch::
     Whether latest commits should be fetched from remote git repository.

 --debug::
 --no-debug::
     Enable or disable debug mode: open a shell in the temporary build
     directory in case of build failure.

 --step::
     This sets the current step. This is only meaningful with the
     showconf command.
