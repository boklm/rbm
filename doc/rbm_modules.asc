rbm_modules(7)
=============

NAME
----
rbm_modules - rbm modules

DESCRIPTION
-----------

An rbm workspace can contain a number of different projects. In some
cases it can be useful to share some of those projects between multiple
workspaces. This can be done using modules.

A module is a subdirectory in the +modules+ directory. If you are using
git, it is possible to store each module directory using a separate
+git-submodule+.

A module directory structure is similar to the main workspace structure:
each module includes a +projects+ directory containing the projects,
a +keyring+ directory containing the gpg keyrings used by the projects,
and a +rbm.module.conf+ containing rbm configuration related to the
projects included in the module.


RBM CONFIGURATION
-----------------

The rbm configuration from a module (the +rbm.module.conf+ and the
project +config+ files) can define any configuration option.
However, for clarity and to avoid name collisions with other modules or
with core rbm options, it is recommended to prefix all option names
with +var_${module_name}+ (where +${module_name}+ is the module name).

The workspace configuration (+rbm.conf+) has priority over the modules
configuration (+rbm.module.conf+). Module configuration is used in
alphabetical order: configuration from a module named +A+ will have
priority over a module named +B+. See
link:rbm_config.html[rbm_config(1)] for more details.

KEYRING
-------

The keyring directory in a module contains gpg keyring files (see the
+gpg_keyring+ option). If a keyring file is available in multiple
modules, the one from the first module in alphabetical order will be
used. If a keyring file is also available in the main workspace's
keyring directory, then it will be used.
