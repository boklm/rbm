remote_exec::
        Run the build on a remote host. See link:rbm_remote.html[rbm_remote(7)]
        for details.

suexec::
        This options takes the +suexec_cmd+ options, and make it run as
        root. By default, it uses sudo for that. You need to set this
        option if you want to use an other mechanism to run commands as
        root.

debug::
        This option enable or disable the debug mode. When enabled, a
        shell will be opened in the temporary build directory in case
        of build failure.

abbrev::
        This option returns the abbreviated commit hash of the +git_hash+
        or +hg_hash+ commit.

abbrev_length::
        This option sets the length of the abbreviated commits, when
        using the +abbrev+ option.

isatty::
        This option is true when stdout is connected to a tty.

tar::
        Use this options instead of 'tar' in build scripts when you want
        to create deterministic tar files. This options set tar arguments
        so that owner and group of files is set to root, and mtime is
        set to +timestamp+. This option takes a +tar_src+ argument which
        is an array containing source files or directories, and a +tar_args+
        argument which is the tar arguments to create the file (something
        like '-cf filename.tar'). By default, GNU options are used in
        tar and find, but you can disable that with +gnu_utils+.

zip::
        Use this option instead of 'zip' in build scripts when you want
        to create deterministic zip files. This option takes a +zip_src+
        argument which is an array containing source files or directories,
        and a +zip_args+ arguments which is usually the destination zip
        file, and optionally other zip options. By default, GNU options
        are used in find, but you can disable that with +gnu_utils+.
        The 'zip' command will be used to create the zip file, unless
        +use_7z+ is set, in which case '7z' will be used instead. In this
        case, +7z_bin+ can be used to select the '7z' command (for cases
        where the command is '7zz' instead of '7z') and +7z_opts+ can
        be used to set additional options to the '7z' command.

install_package::
        This option can be used in a script when you need to install a
        package. The packages to be installed should be set in option
        +pkg_name+. It will use apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu, yum on Fedora,
        zypper on openSUSE and urpmi on Mageia/Mandriva.

num_procs::
        This option allows to specify the number of CPUs used to
        parallelize the build. By default it is set to whatever value
        +nrpoc+ is returning on the build machine.

touch::
        This option can be used to set the mtime of files to +timestamp+.
        It expects the file to touch as as argument following on the same line.
